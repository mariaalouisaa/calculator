# Javascript calculator with css

👩‍💻 Independent project I am working on *without* the aid of a tutorial, simply to practice JS, CSS, testing and refactoring.

---

### Application features (so far):
- 🐭 Onclick eventListners
- ⚒️ DOM Manipulation
- 🤖 JS ES6

--- 
### Still to do:
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] JS refeactoring
- [ ] Allow users to use keyboard with window event listners
- [ ] Accesability tests
- [ ] CSS refactor for responsive design

*(Please see issues for more info)*

Still a work in progess. JS needs refactoring and the CSS is only currently for structure.
