# Javascript calculator with css

👩‍💻 Independent project I am working on *without* the aid of a tutorial, simply to practice JS, CSS, testing and refactoring.

---

### Project features (so far):
- 🐭 Onclick eventListners
- ⚒️ DOM Manipulation
- 🤖 JS => ES6 {}
- 🧪 Unit tests
- 📚 Semantic HTML
- 🔍 Impaired-user friendly

--- 
### Still to do:
- [ ] JS refeactoring
- [ ] Allow users to use keyboard with window event listners
- [ ] Final accesability tests
- [ ] CSS refactor

*(Please see issues for more info)*

Still a work in progess. JS needs refactoring and the CSS is only currently for structure.
